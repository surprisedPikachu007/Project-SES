  "A great feet. In Centurion, we had to learn from the mistakes. We came back very well, especially our bowlers. Had some plans and the boys got rewarded. We applied ourselves, we batted well to get a 100-run lead, not pleasing to see the last six wickets. We knew that it's going to be a short game, we knew ever run matters, to get that lead was very important. (On Siraj) Very special, something you don;t get to see very often. We spoke about keeping things simple and that's what happened. The pitch did the rest. Lot of credit to Siraj, Bumrah, Mukesh and Prasidh. Whenever you come here, it's challenging. We have played a lot of good cricket outside India, we take a lot of pride. We would have loved to win the series. South Africa is a great team, they always challenges us, they are sch a good team. We can take a lot of pride from this performance. (On Elgar) Such an important player for SA, very gritty, we apprentice that. I'd like to wish him the best. Brilliant career, best wishes ahead.\n\nIndia skipper Rohit Sharma after win"
